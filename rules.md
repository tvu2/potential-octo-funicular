# X-Team 37 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* We would first try to break down the project to smaller tasks that are as specific and independent as possible. Ideally, we would want all tasks to have the same level of difficulty but we understand that this is not always possible. 
* We would then ask each team member if they have a preference for or if he/she is willing to take up one or more tasks. If there is more than one person or more than the needed amount of people to work on a specific task, we will assign the task using one of the following strategies: random assignment (like flipping a coin), or skill-based assignment. Preferably, however, each member takes the tasks they are most willing to do but we like to encourage our team members to take on tasks that they may not be very familiar with so that they can learn new skills. 
* Occasionally, we would need to reassign the tasks among team members as some tasks maybe more challenging or time consuming than others or there could be multiple tasks that are very similar. In these cases the challenging tasks may need to be reassigned to more than one team members or one or more members can work on groups of similar tasks.  

## How we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* We will track progress through commits and make sure that people are comitting progressively instead of just right before the due date.	
* We have a Slack channel in which we can discuss our progress. The team leader is responsible for checking in with each member at least once per week to make sure they are doing okay with assigned tasks and that the task assigned is managable for the person doing it.

## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* Once a team member is assigned a task, he/she should start working on it as soon as possible to quickly identify any difficulties that he/she may encounter. 
* Once the issue has been identified, the team member should try to resolve it on his/her own for no more than 1-2 hours or shorter depending on how close we are to the deadline. If he/she is still stuck, let other team members know the followings: a description of the problem, how it would affect a particular task and/or the whole project, what he/she has tried to resolve the issue. Giving this information would help other team member quickly get up to speed on the issue and hopefully can come up with a solution to resolve it.
* Team member is encouraged to use the "Issues" functionality that comes with every GitHub repos to report/document any issues or difficulties associated with the tasks, the codes, or the overall project. 

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
* By monitoring the progress of the tasks, we know which tasks are completed and which are not. The team leader therefore can assign one or more team members who have finished their tasks to help other members complete their tasks. 
* In addition to the assigned tasks, each team member is assigned to code-review another team member to make sure the code follows the standards predefined by the team. Doing so would help ensure there are fewer mistakes that need to be fixed at the end when the deadlines are near. 

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
* The general rule is to always help each other out whenever we can so that we can succeed together.
* Be responsive to team's email, Slack messages. 
* Attend team meetings unless discussed with team.  
* Write code with conventions which can be adopted from CS400 assignment and/or decided by team:   
    + Professional looking and readable codes  
    + Use headers, comments generously and effectively  
    + Method names, variable names should be as descriptive as possible    
* Try and write pseudo codes with group before coding individual parts. 
* Be respectful and honest with each other even when there are conflicts or disagreements. 
* Each team member is deserved the benefit of the doubt so if he/she breaks the rules a couple of times, we should try to understand his/her reasons and help him/her avoid repeating the mistakes in the future even if we need to do more to make up for the work that he/she misses.
