# X-Team 37 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

* We will track progress through commits and make sure that people are comitting progressively instead of just right before the due date.

* We have a slack channel in which we can discuss our progress. The team leader is responsible for checking in with each member at least once per week to make sure they are doing okay with assigned tasks and that the task assigned is managable for the pereson doing it,

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed



## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together


* Attend team meetings unless discussed with team  
* Write code with conventions decided by team  
* Try and write pseudo code with group before coding individual parts
