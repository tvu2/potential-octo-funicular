# X-Team 37 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

* Ask each team member if they have a preference for a certain task or would like to take up a certain task. If they are willing to do a certain task then assign them to the task if possible. If there is more than one person or more than the needed amount of people to work on a specific part, than we can flip a coin. Preferably, however, each member takes the task they are most willing to do. 

* If a team member is having trouble with a task, they can ask in slack or in a team meeting for help. Team members can pool together to help complete the task or help the team member complete it themselves.
